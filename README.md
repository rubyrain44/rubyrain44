# 👋 Hello world! My name is Lorraine and I am a full stack software developer ready to code!
- 🐱‍👤 I am a coding ninja thanks to the online bootcamp that I graduated from- Coding Dojo! I am passionate, driven, and excited to get into the field and start creating something amazing!
- 📃 I received a certificate upon graduating for my full stack focuses in: Web Fundamentals | Python | JavaScript | Java
- 💖 My passion is to be apart of developing something and helpful for users that they can use in their everyday lives.
- 💭 My dream job within the field would be to work on a music application or something for event/community building. Music is one of my greatest loves and I would love to be apart of creating something fun with       that. I also very much enjoy getting out and about and exploring the world we live in and getting to see and meet new places and people. I think building an app to help bring others together or showcase             exciting things in the area to explore would be incredibly fun and helpful.
- 🎲 My life's dream job would be to one day open my own board game cafe, with it's own companion app that I've built to use alongside it, where people can go to relax, have fun, and make memories.
- 💕 My hobbies & interests include adventures/road trips, hiking, drawing/painting, gaming, listening to music, and photography. 
- 💻 For now, you will find me working on creating new applications of different ideas I get that I would love to see built and used by people everyday to impact their lives in either a productive way or just to use for fun!
