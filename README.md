# 👋 Hello world! My name is Lorraine and I'm an aspiring software developer!
- 💕 My hobbies & interests include adventures/road trips, hiking, drawing/painting, gaming, listening to music, and photography. 
- 🐱‍👤 I am a coding ninja thanks to the online bootcamp that I graduated from- Coding Dojo!
- 📜 I received a certificate upon graduating for my full stack focuses in: Web Fundamentals | Python | JavaScript | Java
- 💖 My passion within coding leans more towards front end work. I love finding cool and impactful ways to excite the user when presented with whatever project they've stumbled onto.
- 💭 My dream job within the field would be to work with Spotify. I'm a huge fan of music and I love using the application every day, and I'm constantly finding new ways I'd like to build and improve upon it to make it an even more enjoyable and interactive application.
- 🎲 My life's dream job would be to one day open my own board game cafe, with it's own companion app that I've built to use alongside it, where people can go to relax, have fun, and make memories.
- 💻 For now, you will find me working on creating new applications of different ideas I get that I would love to see built and used by people everyday to impact their lives in either a productive way or just to use for fun!
