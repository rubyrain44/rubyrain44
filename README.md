- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name's Lorraine, or you can call me Rain!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a student with Coding Dojo and working towards learning my three full stack languages- Python, JavaScript, and Java!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in expanding my creative side and seeing what kind of fun and cool things I can create!
- ðŸ’­ My dream job within the field would be to work with Spotify/Soundcloud, or with music in anyway.
